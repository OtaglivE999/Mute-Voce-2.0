# Muta Voce
Analyze audio for soft voices—far-field or similar—enhance the signal, perform voice-fingerprinting, and build a catalog of voice prints. Keep detailed logs of every detected voice, recording attributes that aid identification (voice color, formants, idiosyncrasies), plus date and precise timestamps. Provide an enhanced track that makes the voices clearly audible and distinct from background noise that other systems might misclassify due to limited training libraries

## Usage

Run `run_all.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `run_all.bat` (Windows). You can provide an input
file path as an argument, e.g.

```sh
./run_all.sh path/to/file.mp4
```

If no path is given, the script prompts for one.
